title: MCP Server
description: Use the n8n-as-code MCP Server to give any MCP-compatible AI client access to n8n node knowledge, workflow search, and validation.
---

The `@n8n-as-code/mcp` package is a dedicated [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes n8n-as-code tools to any MCP-compatible AI client — Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Windsurf, and others.

It gives AI assistants offline access to the full n8n node catalogue, community workflow examples, and workflow validation without requiring a live n8n instance.

Live workspace context uses the normal environments model: `n8nac-config.json` stores workspace environments, remote API keys stay local, and `n8n-manager` owns only local managed instances and tunnels. Initialize the workspace with `n8nac env` when you want an MCP-backed assistant to reason from the same local context as the CLI or editor.

See the [CLI guide](/docs/usage/cli) and [n8n-manager guide](/docs/usage/n8n-manager) for setup details.

## Two MCP surfaces

There are two different MCP surfaces involved in this documentation:

| Surface | Owner | Purpose | Default role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@n8n-as-code/mcp` | n8n-as-code | Exposes N8NAC tools, bundled knowledge, workflow examples, validation, and optional brokered native wrappers to MCP clients | The MCP server you configure in Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, or other AI clients |
| Native n8n MCP server | n8n | Exposes live n8n instance capabilities such as workflows, executions, credentials metadata, projects, folders, native nodes, and workflow-builder tools | Optional upstream live assist endpoint used only when explicitly enabled |

For normal n8n-as-code usage, configure your AI client to connect to `@n8n-as-code/mcp`. Do not replace it with the native n8n MCP endpoint unless you intentionally want a direct, non-N8NAC workflow. In assist mode, `@n8n-as-code/mcp` remains the broker: it exposes the N8NAC tools and calls the native n8n MCP server only through approved wrapper tools.

## What the n8n-as-code MCP server provides

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `search_n8n_knowledge` | Search the bundled n8n node catalogue and documentation |
| `get_n8n_node_info` | Get the full schema and metadata for a specific node |
| `search_n8n_workflow_examples` | Search 7 000+ community workflow examples |
| `get_n8n_workflow_example` | Get metadata and download URL for a specific example |
| `validate_n8n_workflow` | Validate a workflow against the bundled JSON schema |
| `search_n8n_docs` | Search bundled n8n documentation pages |
| `get_n8n_native_mcp_status` | Inspect optional native n8n MCP assist configuration and discovered tools |

The core tools operate entirely on bundled, offline data — no network access to n8n is required. Native n8n MCP assist is disabled by default and only makes network calls when explicitly enabled.

## Optional native n8n MCP assist through the broker

n8n 2.x includes an instance-level MCP server that can expose live workflow, node, execution, credential, project, folder, and workflow-builder capabilities. `@n8n-as-code/mcp` can optionally connect to that native server as a complementary assist layer while still remaining the MCP server exposed to your AI client.

This is a brokered integration: your AI client connects to the `n8n-as-code` MCP server, and the `n8n-as-code` MCP server calls the native n8n MCP server only when the optional assist mode is enabled. The current wrapper set is read-only; native runtime execution belongs in explicit test/execution flows, not automatic workflow editing.

This integration is designed to complement the local n8n-as-code workflow, not replace it:

- Use bundled `n8n-as-code` knowledge and `n8nac` commands as the default source of truth.
- Use native MCP assist for live discovery, server-side validation, credential metadata, execution inspection, native node definitions, and explicit runtime execution strategies when it complements `n8nac test`.
- Keep `.workflow.ts` files and Git as the durable source of truth.
- Do not store native MCP bearer tokens in project files.
- Do not expose native MCP assist over non-loopback HTTP/SSE transports unless the MCP transport is separately authenticated and `N8NAC_NATIVE_MCP_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` is set.
- Treat native runtime execution as a side-effecting operation, like `n8nac test`. Agents should run it only from an explicit user request or generated execution strategy.
- Do not use native MCP create, update, publish, archive, or destructive data-table operations as an automatic path. This package currently exposes only read-only native wrappers.

### Use cases

Use native MCP assist when the connected n8n instance knows something that the local repository or bundled knowledge cannot know by itself:

| Use case | Prefer native MCP assist for | Prefer local `n8nac` for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Live workflow discovery | Finding workflows that exist in the connected n8n instance, checking names, IDs, active state, tags, projects, and folders | Listing and editing `.workflow.ts` files in the configured `workflowsPath` |
| Drift investigation | Comparing live workflow details with what the repository expects | Pulling, pushing, resolving conflicts, and keeping Git as the source of truth |
| Execution troubleshooting | Searching recent executions, inspecting failure status, and optionally reading execution payloads | Normal execution history commands that already work through the n8n API |
| Credentials inventory | Listing credential metadata without secret values so an agent can understand required integrations | Creating, editing, or revealing credential secret values |
| Native knowledge | Fetching live node definitions, native SDK guidance, and server-side validation from the connected n8n version | Offline node knowledge, examples, docs search, and schema-first workflow authoring |
| Runtime execution strategy | Future explicit workflow execution by ID, non-webhook workflow testing, native pin-data preparation, or direct execution diagnostics | `n8nac test` when the goal is to exercise the real webhook, chat, or form trigger contract |

Do not use native MCP assist as a shortcut for workflow authoring. Creating, updating, publishing, archiving, or deleting workflows directly in n8n can bypass `.workflow.ts` and create drift unless there is a deliberate sync-back design.

### Enable assist for an environment

First enable and configure the native MCP server in n8n, then attach its endpoint and bearer token to the relevant n8n-as-code environment. This keeps the packaged onboarding model intact: Claude Code plugin users, VS Code Workbench users, and MCP-client users all share the same workspace environment configuration.

The non-secret native MCP settings are stored in `n8nac-config.json` under the environment. The bearer token is stored locally through the same secret store used for n8n API keys.

```bash
n8nac env add Dev --base-url https://your-n8n.example.com --workflows-path workflows/dev
n8nac env auth set Dev --api-key-stdin
n8nac native-mcp configure Dev --url https://your-n8n.example.com/mcp-server/http --token-stdin
n8nac native-mcp doctor Dev --json
```

If `--url` is omitted, `native-mcp configure` derives the default endpoint from the environment URL by appending `/mcp-server/http`.

```bash
n8nac native-mcp configure Dev --token-stdin
```

The resulting workspace config contains only non-secret fields:

```json
{
  "id": "dev",
  "name": "Dev",
  "nativeMcp": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "assist",
    "url": "https://your-n8n.example.com/mcp-server/http",
    "requireSyncBack": true
  }
}
```

Use these commands to inspect or disable the environment-scoped native assist configuration:

```bash
n8nac native-mcp status Dev --include-tools --json
n8nac native-mcp tools Dev --json
n8nac native-mcp disable Dev
```

For advanced/container deployments, environment variables still override the environment-scoped configuration:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `N8NAC_NATIVE_MCP_ENABLED=1` | Force-enables the optional native assist layer |
| `N8NAC_NATIVE_MCP_MODE=assist` | Keeps n8n-as-code as the broker and exposes only approved wrapper tools |
| `N8N_NATIVE_MCP_URL` or `N8NAC_NATIVE_MCP_URL` | Overrides the native n8n MCP HTTP endpoint |
| `N8N_NATIVE_MCP_TOKEN` or `N8NAC_NATIVE_MCP_TOKEN` | Overrides the bearer token used by the broker |
| `N8NAC_NATIVE_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS` | Overrides request timeout, default `30000` |
| `N8NAC_NATIVE_MCP_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` | Allows exposing native assist wrappers through non-loopback HTTP/SSE broker transports |
| `N8NAC_NATIVE_MCP_ALLOW_EXECUTION_DATA=1` | Allows full execution payloads from `get_n8n_live_execution` when requested |

Keep `N8NAC_NATIVE_MCP_ALLOW_REMOTE` unset for local desktop clients. Set it only when the broker transport is separately authenticated and intentionally reachable beyond loopback.

### Use from an MCP client

For Claude Desktop or other MCP-only clients, configure the client to launch `@n8n-as-code/mcp`. The native n8n MCP endpoint is not configured in the MCP client; it is resolved from the active n8n-as-code environment, or from the environment-variable override path above.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-as-code": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@n8n-as-code/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "N8N_AS_CODE_PROJECT_DIR": "/absolute/path/to/your/n8n-as-code-workspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you already start `n8nac-mcp` or `n8nac mcp` from the workspace root, the project directory is resolved from the current working directory. For HTTP broker mode, start the broker with `n8nac-mcp --http` and configure your MCP client with the broker URL, not the native n8n URL.

Claude Code plugin users and VS Code Agent Workbench users do not need to configure `@n8n-as-code/mcp` manually. They use the packaged plugin/extension flows, and native MCP assist is configured on the n8n-as-code environment.

Useful agent prompts once assist mode is enabled:

- "Check whether native n8n MCP assist is configured and list the discovered native capabilities."
- "Search the live n8n instance for workflows related to invoicing and compare them with the local workflow files."
- "Inspect the latest failed executions for this workflow and summarize the failing node and error message."
- "Use native node definitions to verify this workflow uses parameters supported by the connected n8n version."
- "Validate this generated workflow locally and with native n8n validation, then report any divergence."
- "List credential metadata required by this live workflow without exposing credential secret values."

### Native assist tools

When the active environment has `nativeMcp.enabled=true`, or when the environment-variable override path is enabled, the MCP server also exposes these read-only wrappers. Use `n8nac native-mcp status --include-tools --json` to confirm which underlying native tools your n8n version supports:

| Tool | Native n8n tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search_n8n_live_workflows` | `search_workflows` | Search live workflow previews |
| `get_n8n_live_workflow_details` | `get_workflow_details` | Inspect sanitized live workflow details |
| `search_n8n_live_projects` | `search_projects` | Discover n8n projects |
| `search_n8n_live_folders` | `search_folders` | Discover folders in a project |
| `list_n8n_live_credentials` | `list_credentials` | List credential metadata without secrets |
| `search_n8n_live_executions` | `search_executions` | Search execution metadata |
| `get_n8n_live_execution` | `get_execution` | Inspect an execution. Full execution payloads require `N8NAC_NATIVE_MCP_ALLOW_EXECUTION_DATA=1` |
| `get_n8n_native_sdk_reference` | `get_sdk_reference` | Read native workflow-builder SDK guidance |
| `search_n8n_native_nodes` | `search_nodes` | Search live node definitions |
| `get_n8n_native_node_types` | `get_node_types` | Fetch native TypeScript node definitions |
| `validate_n8n_native_workflow_code` | `validate_workflow` | Validate native workflow-builder code without creating workflows |

### Runtime execution strategy

Some n8n native MCP servers can expose runtime tools such as `execute_workflow`, `test_workflow`, or `prepare_test_pin_data`. This broker does not expose those tools in the current read-only wrapper set, but they are a good fit for future explicit execution flows when they complement existing `n8nac` behavior.

- Prefer `n8nac test` when the goal is to exercise the real webhook, chat, or form trigger contract.
- Prefer native runtime execution when it can do something `n8nac test` cannot do well, such as executing by workflow ID, testing non-webhook workflows, preparing native pin-data tests, or returning direct execution diagnostics.
- Treat both `n8nac test` and native runtime execution as side-effecting runtime actions because workflows can send messages, write data, or call external APIs.
- Keep native workflow create, update, publish, unpublish, archive, and destructive data-table operations separate from runtime execution. Those control-plane mutations can create drift from `.workflow.ts` and require a stronger code-first sync-back design before being exposed.

### Diagnostics

Use the CLI diagnostics before relying on native assist:

```bash
n8nac native-mcp status --include-tools --json
n8nac native-mcp tools
n8nac native-mcp doctor --json
```

Use `status` for a redacted configuration snapshot, `tools` to list the native tools discovered from n8n, and `doctor` as a preflight check. `doctor` exits non-zero when assist is disabled, misconfigured, unreachable, or unable to list native tools.

The MCP server also exposes `get_n8n_native_mcp_status`, so an MCP client can ask the broker whether native assist is enabled and which wrapper tools are available without reading local environment variables.

## Installation

The MCP server (`@n8n-as-code/mcp`) delegates all tool calls to the `n8nac` CLI at runtime. `n8nac` is declared as a dependency and is installed automatically.

### Option 1 — npx (no persistent install)

```bash
npx -y @n8n-as-code/mcp
```

### Option 2 — Global install (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @n8n-as-code/mcp
n8nac-mcp
```

### Option 3 — Docker

The Docker images bundle both `n8nac` and `@n8n-as-code/mcp` — no separate installation needed. See the **[Docker guide](#docker)** below.

## Transport modes

The server supports three transport protocols:

| Mode | Flag | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stdio` | _(default)_ | Local clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code) that launch the process directly |
| `http` | `--http` | Persistent container or remote server, accessed via Streamable HTTP |
| `sse` | `--sse` | Legacy clients that require SSE — prefer `http` for new setups |

:::warning SSE is deprecated
The SSE transport is [officially deprecated in the MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse-deprecated). **Always prefer HTTP** for new setups. SSE is supported only for backwards compatibility with older clients.
:::

### Starting with HTTP transport

```bash
n8nac-mcp --http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

The server then listens at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.

## How it works

The MCP server is a thin protocol layer. Offline knowledge and validation calls are delegated to the `n8nac` CLI, which ships with a bundled knowledge index:

```text
MCP Client → @n8n-as-code/mcp → n8nac CLI → bundled knowledge index
```

By default there is no live n8n MCP assist and no native MCP network call. When native MCP assist is enabled on the active n8n-as-code environment, read-only live wrappers use this additional path:

```text
MCP Client → @n8n-as-code/mcp → native n8n MCP server → live n8n instance
```

Native assist is optional and does not change the recommended Git/TypeScript workflow source of truth.
